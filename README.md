#### MVP 

- Allow users to review a beer as well as see recent reviews of beers. 
- Allow users to search for a beer based on a specific quality (alcohol percentage, hops) 
- Store reviews and ratings in AirTable. 
- Have three functioning pages that display information. (A review page, a page to submit reviews, and a suggestion page that allows users to input/search)

#### PostMVP  

- Advanced CSS that allows for easy navigating/showable content 
- Adding a conditional that changes the color of a div that holds a beer with a high rating vs low rating (unable to complete)
